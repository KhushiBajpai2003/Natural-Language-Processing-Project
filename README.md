# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF PRODUCT REVIEWS
# Overview
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of product reviews using natural language processing techniques. By employing machine learning algorithms, we can determine whether a review expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards a product. This README provides an overview of the project structure, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.


# Data Preparation:

Ensure that your dataset containing product reviews is in a compatible format such as CSV or JSON.
Make sure the dataset includes a column for the text of the reviews and, optionally, a column for ground truth sentiment labels (if available for training purposes).

# Inference:

Use the trained model to analyze sentiment in new product reviews.

Modify the analyze.py script to load your trained model and process the input data.

Run the script and provide the path to your input data:

# Output:

The analysis results will be saved to an output file (e.g., output.csv) containing the original reviews along with their predicted sentiment labels.
# Model Evaluation
If you've trained a model, it's essential to evaluate its performance.
Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness in sentiment classification.
Cross-validation or a separate validation dataset can help ensure the model's generalization ability.
